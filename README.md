# zcmd

This is merely a GitHub repost of zcmd by [ZeeX](https://github.com/Zeex) because it does not exist on GitHub making package management with sampctl difficult.

The original topic and documentation [is here](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?t=91354).

@Zeex: If you want to host this on your own account, open an issue and I will delete this repository.

## Usage

Simply add to your `pawn.json` and include:

```json
{
    "dependencies": ["Southclaws/zcmd"]
}
```

```pawn
#include <zcmd>
```
